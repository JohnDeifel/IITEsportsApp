Hello, this is the repository for the Codify IIT Esports application!

All of our code will be in the folders, and everything else will be right here

For those of you who are developers, make sure you have:
-visual studio code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
-flutter sdk: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
-android sdk: https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools

If you are on mac, download xcode from the app store

Once you have all of these dependencies, clone the development branch into your local device and you are good to go!


For those of you on the UI/UX team, please update this file with any new layouts that you create so the programmers can continue working. Thank you!
